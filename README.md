### Pre-requisites
##### [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/)
##### [TudatPy](https://tudat-space.readthedocs.io)
To install Tudat(Py), we recommend the use of a terminal (command line) interface. On Unix system (Linux and Mac), `conda` should be integrated with the terminal, and you can open your terminal directly. On Windows, you can find a program called `Anaconda Prompt` in the Windows search. The `Anaconda Prompt` is equivalent to the terminal use of `conda` on Unix. Some Unix commands are made available in this prompt, although most usage is equivalent to the Windows shell (see below for some useful terminal commands).

Open a terminal. Then, first verify that `conda` is installed via using the following command:
```shell
conda --version
```

Then, ensure that `conda` is updated.
```shell
conda update conda
```
Download this [environment.yaml](https://github.com/cfortunylombra/PRIDE-Doppler-LaRa/blob/main/environment.yaml).

In your terminal navigate to the directory containing this file (with the `cd` command), and use the following command:
```shell
conda env create -f environment.yaml
```
