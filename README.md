### Pre-requisites
* For Windows Users: Windows Subsystem for Linux ([Installing WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install))
	- All procedures, including the following prerequisite, assume the use of WSL. Power users who wish to do otherwise, must do so at their own risk, with reduced support from the team.
    - Note that WSL is entirely separated from Windows. This means that even if Anaconda/Miniconda, Python, or any other software is already installed on Windows, it needs to be installed again in WSL, as a Linux install.
* Anaconda installation ([Installing Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/))
* `tudat-bundle` ([Installing `tudat-bundle`](https://github.com/tudat-team/tudat-bundle))

To install `tudat-bundle`, please follow carefully the [setup instructions](https://github.com/tudat-team/tudat-bundle#setup).
